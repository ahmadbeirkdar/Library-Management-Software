## Library Management Software

Non GUI implementation for now, planned to possibly use QT

still in major development

No ETA

  

Right now the following works:

* Storing books, users and the sign in and sign out of the books

* User and book search

* Currently it could work as a personally library management software, it has the essential features.


What is planned soon:

* Due dates, with email system

* Rolling out GUI slowly


Files:

* test.py, is a simple test file to show real world use, but this is the non-GUI implementation

* datafunc.py, ok I agree an ugly name, but this is the feel in which all the functions are stored for now

* classes.py, pretty clear, where the classes for the parser, books and users is stored, I don't see this file changing drastically for now. Maybe some small additions or changes

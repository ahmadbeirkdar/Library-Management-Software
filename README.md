Using QT GUI framework

still in major development

No ETA

  

Current Features:

* Storing books, users and the sign in and sign out of the books

* User and book search

* Due dates w/ emails

* Currently it could work as a personally library management software, it has the essential features.

* Simple GUI, working on a full implementation 


What is planned soon/TODO:

* View the following link: 

* https://github.com/ahmadbeirkdar/Library-Management-Software/projects

* users.csv - Col 1 ID(From 0 to whatever), Col 2 name, Col 3 username, Col 4 email

Files:

* test.py, is a simple test file to show real world use, but this is the non-GUI implementation

* datafunc.py, ok I agree an ugly name, but this is the feel in which all the functions are stored for now

* classes.py, pretty clear, where the classes for the parser, books and users is stored, I don't see this file changing drastically for now. Maybe some small additions or changes

* guisetup.py, this file is just to setup all the classes and functions for the gui, it will most likely expand

* gui folder, includes everything gui

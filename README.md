Files:

* test.py, is a simple test file to show real world use, but this is the non-GUI implementation

* datafunc.py, ok I agree an ugly name, but this is the feel in which all the functions are stored for now

* classes.py, pretty clear, where the classes for the parser, books and users is stored, I don't see this file changing drastically for now. Maybe some small additions or changes

* guisetup.py, this file is just to setup all the classes and functions for the gui, it will most likely expand

* gui folder, includes everything gui
